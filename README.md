# WebGPU_Early_Torus_Prototype

Interactive WebGPU prototype that ray-marches nested tori and an optional spherical projection to demonstrate a “recursive toroidal hologram”: an energy-field of ~8k advected particles and a mock JWST early-galaxy sky are encoded to a torus-UV boundary texture each frame and then sampled back onto the toroidal shell. UI sliders expose R/r, tilt, child shift, smooth-union k, exposure, and recursion depth; toggles switch Sphere projection, Hologram mode (interior/throat view), JWST overlay, and energy field. HUD shows GPU + FPS; controls: WASD/mouse, Q/E (down/up), Shift (faster), O (auto-orbit), plus a simple audio heartbeat. Includes ten inline JWST mock points (z≈10.38–12.93) colored by redshift for illustrative seeding. Run locally in Chrome/Edge 113+ with WebGPU; no server required
